# PORTFOLIO
## 🔎 ABOUT ME
<br>I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in software quality assurance and testing. I enjoy analyzing systems, identifying issues, and ensuring applications run smoothly according to user requirements.<br>
<br>I am eager to learn different testing methods, write Test Cases, and use basic testing tools such as Jira and TestRail. Additionally, I am interested in learning automation testing—although I have not yet used automation frameworks, I am motivated and ready to start from the basics.<br>
<br>I am a fast learner, detail-oriented, and enjoy solving problems with logical thinking. I am excited to apply my skills and enthusiasm to gain practical experience in software testing as an intern.

## PROJECTS
<br>
From testing from the website [Saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/) (Swag Labs) is a sample website created by Sauce Labs for people to practice doing Browser Automation and Test Automation. It is a simulated E-commerce website with complete features for testers to practice testing.<br>
<br>

### Test Automate Testing
I tested automate testing by playwite with javascript.<br>

End-to-End (E2E) Tests
E2E tests, located in e2e/, aim to verify the complete functionality of the application. <br>
They cover scenarios such as user authentication, navigation, and interactions with different pages.
