# PORTFOLIO
## 🔎 ABOUT ME
<br>I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in software quality assurance and testing. I enjoy analyzing systems, identifying issues, and ensuring applications run smoothly according to user requirements.<br>
<br>I am eager to learn different testing methods, write Test Cases, and use basic testing tools such as Jira and TestRail. Additionally, I am interested in learning automation testing—although I have not yet used automation frameworks, I am motivated and ready to start from the basics.<br>
<br>I am a fast learner, detail-oriented, and enjoy solving problems with logical thinking. I am excited to apply my skills and enthusiasm to gain practical experience in software testing as an intern.

## PROJECTS
